All Luna Co. Audio plugins are **100% free** — no trials, no feature locks, no nag screens. Development is funded entirely by optional support from users who find value in these tools.

If these plugins help your music, consider giving back!

## Why Free?

I believe great audio tools should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget. The Linux audio community especially deserves quality plugins, and making them free removes barriers for hobbyists, students, and creators worldwide.

Your support — whether financial or through spreading the word — makes this possible. Thank you!
