Multi-Comp is a professional multi-mode dynamics compressor that brings classic hardware compression styles to your DAW, completely free.

## Overview

Multi-Comp provides 8 distinct compression modes, each capturing the character of classic hardware designs:

- **Vintage Opto**: Classic tube optical leveling amplifier
- **Vintage FET**: Vintage FET limiter with All-Buttons mode
- **Classic VCA**: Punchy 1970s VCA with soft knee
- **Bus Compressor**: British console bus compressor
- **Studio FET**: Cleaner, modern FET limiter
- **Studio VCA**: Modern British dual VCA compressor
- **Digital**: Transparent, precise digital compression
- **Multiband**: 4-band with Linkwitz-Riley crossovers

From smooth optical compression to aggressive FET limiting, and from precise digital control to powerful multiband processing, Multi-Comp covers every dynamics need.

## Compression Modes

### Vintage Opto

![Vintage Opto mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/vintage-opto.png)

Classic 1960s tube optical leveling amplifier. This design defined the sound of smooth, musical compression and remains a studio standard for vocals and bass.

- Program-dependent attack/release via T4 optical cell emulation
- Peak Reduction control for classic opto workflow
- Compress/Limit modes
- Tube stage modeling with authentic harmonic character
- Perfect for vocals, bass, and mix bus

### Vintage FET

![Vintage FET mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/vintage-fet.png)

Classic late-1960s FET limiting amplifier. All-discrete Class A design known for its aggressive, punchy character and ultra-fast response.

- Classic ratio buttons: 4:1, 8:1, 12:1, 20:1
- **All-Buttons mode** for the famous extreme compression/distortion
- Ultra-fast attack times (20μs minimum)
- Authentic transistor saturation with input/output transformer modeling

### Classic VCA

![Classic VCA mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/classic-vca.png)

Punchy, aggressive 1970s VCA compressor with soft-knee compression. A studio workhorse for drums and percussive sources.

- Fast, precise VCA compression
- OverEasy soft knee option for gentle compression
- Clean, transparent compression with punch
- Excellent for drums and percussion

### Bus Compressor

![Bus Compressor mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/bus-compressor.png)

The quintessential British console bus compressor. Found on virtually every major mixing console, it's the secret weapon for mix bus "glue."

- Stepped attack times (0.1 to 30ms) matching the original detents
- Stepped release with Auto mode
- Classic mix bus "glue" character
- 2:1, 4:1, and 10:1 ratio settings

### Studio FET

![Studio FET mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/studio-fet.png)

Later revision FET limiter, offering a cleaner, more refined sound while retaining the fast FET response.

- Cleaner character with ~30% of Vintage harmonics
- More controlled transient response
- Same ultra-fast attack characteristics
- Better suited for modern, cleaner productions

### Studio VCA

![Studio VCA mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/studio-vca.png)

Modern British dual VCA compressor known for its clean, musical compression. A favorite for vocals and mix bus applications where transparency is key.

- RMS detection for musical response
- Soft knee option
- Ultra-clean compression with minimal coloration
- Excellent for vocals and mastering

### Digital

![Digital mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/digital.png)

Transparent, mathematically precise digital compression with zero coloration. When you need surgical dynamics control without any hardware character.

- Accurate peak/RMS detection
- No coloration or saturation
- Perfect for surgical dynamics control
- Ideal when transparency is paramount

### Multiband

![Multiband mode](/assets/images/plugins/multi-comp/multiband.png)

Professional 4-band multiband compressor with Linkwitz-Riley crossovers for phase-coherent band splitting.

- **4 frequency bands** (Low, Lo-Mid, Hi-Mid, High)
- Adjustable crossover frequencies
- Per-band threshold, ratio, attack, release, makeup
- Per-band solo buttons
- LED-style gain reduction meters per band

## Analog Emulation

Multi-Comp features hardware-accurate analog emulation that captures the authentic character of classic compressors:

### Transformer Emulation
Each vintage mode includes input and output transformer modeling with authentic high-frequency characteristics:

| Mode | Input Transformer | Output Transformer |
|:-----|:------------------|:-------------------|
| Vintage Opto | 18kHz rolloff | 16kHz rolloff |
| Vintage FET | 20kHz rolloff | 22kHz rolloff |
| Bus | 22kHz rolloff | 24kHz rolloff |
| VCA/Digital | None (transparent) | None (transparent) |

### Analog Noise
Toggle the "Analog Noise" button to add subtle -80dB analog noise floor, matching the authentic character of hardware units. Disable for completely silent digital behavior.

### Tube and Saturation
- Opto mode includes T4 optical cell and tube stage modeling
- FET mode captures the characteristic Class A transistor saturation
- Bus mode includes the distinctive VCA coloration of classic British consoles
- All analog modes include harmonic generation based on hardware measurements
