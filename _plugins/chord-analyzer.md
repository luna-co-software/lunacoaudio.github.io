changelog:
  - version: "1.2.2"
    date: "2026-09-06"
    changes:
      - "New read-only Detected Chord parameter carrying the exact label the editor shows, so hosts such as Gig Performer can display the chord without opening the editor (#267)"
      - "Detected Inversion is numbered off the matched chord shape: 4th, 5th and 6th for a 9th, 11th or 13th in the bass, and a Slash value for a bass the chord does not spell (#273)"
      - "Editor always fits the host window when the host resizes it below the minimum, instead of overhanging it (#240)"
  - version: "1.2.1"
    date: "2026-08-31"
    changes:
      - "The editor now keeps its aspect ratio when resized, including drags from the host window edge; it could previously be stretched out of shape"
      - "A window size saved by an older build is corrected on load, so the editor no longer reopens clipped"
  - version: "1.2.0"
    date: "2026-08-30"
    changes:
      - "Chord names no longer drop notes: C E G F# reads Cadd#11, not C"
      - "Slash notation for any bass note, including an upper-structure bass such as Cadd#11/F#"
      - "Sixth chords are named correctly in root position: C6 instead of Am7/C"
      - "Voicings that leave out the fifth are now named: C7(no5), Cmaj9(no5) and the other shell voicings"
      - "Altered dominants corrected: C7(#11) where the natural fifth sounds, and 7b9 and 7#9 are now detected"
      - "Two notes read as an interval, for example C+E (M3), instead of a question mark"
  - version: "1.1.4"
    date: "2026-05-13"
    changes:
      - "Cubase: Chord Analyzer MIDI now appears in MIDI Inserts slot (VST3 subcategory Fx|Instrument). Fixes #89"

      - Misc shared LookAndFeel polish
  - version: "1.1.1"
    date: "2026-04-17"
    changes:
      - "Added Respect Sustain parameter (default on): when MIDI CC 64 is held, the detected chord persists until the pedal is released. Useful for piano transcription workflows."
      - "Native LV2 (Headless): added respect_sustain ControlPort at index 10 (existing detection-port indices unchanged)"
  - version: "1.1.0"

Chord Analyzer is a real-time MIDI chord detection and music theory analysis plugin, completely free.

## Overview

Route MIDI to Chord Analyzer and instantly see what chord you're playing, its Roman numeral in your chosen key, and its harmonic function. Get intelligent suggestions for what chord to play next, from basic I-IV-V progressions to advanced chromatic mediants and Coltrane changes.

## Features

### Chord Detection
Recognizes 45 chord types including triads, seventh chords, extended chords (9th, 11th, 13th), altered dominants, sus chords, and power chords. Detects inversions and displays slash notation.

### Music Theory Analysis
Set your key (any root, major or minor) and see Roman numeral analysis for every chord. Harmonic function labels (Tonic, Subdominant, Dominant, Borrowed, Chromatic) help you understand the role each chord plays.

### Chord Suggestions
Three tiers of suggestions based on your current chord:
- **Basic**: Common progressions (I-IV-V, ii-V-I, vi-IV)
- **Intermediate**: Secondary dominants, borrowed chords, tritone substitutions
- **Advanced**: Chromatic mediants, Neapolitan chords, augmented 6th approaches

### Session Recording
Record your chord progressions with timing data and export as JSON for analysis, notation software, or further processing.

### Educational Tooltips
Hover over any element to learn about chord qualities, harmonic functions, and why certain progressions work.

## Three Versions

Chord Analyzer ships in three versions to cover every plugin host:

| Version | Plugin Type | Use In |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Chord Analyzer** | Instrument (with UI) | FL Studio, Ableton Live |
| **Chord Analyzer MIDI** | MIDI Effect (with UI) | Reaper, Bitwig, Logic Pro, Cubase, Ardour, Carla |
| **Chord Analyzer Headless** | Native LV2, no UI (host renders detected chord) | Zynthian and other headless LV2 hosts |

All three share the same chord-detection engine. The difference is how your host classifies and renders the plugin:

- **MIDI variant** sits in the dedicated MIDI / Note FX slot of modern DAWs and brings the full visualizer with it.
- **Headless variant** declares native LV2 output control ports so headless LV2 hosts (Zynthian, etc.) can display the detected chord in their own UI without ever loading our visualizer.

If you're on a desktop DAW, use the **MIDI** variant. If you're on Zynthian or any LV2 host that doesn't run a plugin GUI, use the **Headless** variant.

## DAW Setup Guide

### Bitwig Studio

1. Add your synth to a MIDI track as normal
2. In the device chain, click **+** before your synth
3. Search for **"Chord Analyzer MIDI"** in the **Note FX** category and add it
4. MIDI passes through automatically, so your synth still receives all notes

### Reaper

1. Open the FX chain on your MIDI/instrument track
2. Click **Add** and search for **"Chord Analyzer MIDI"** (VST3)
3. Drag it above your synth in the chain
4. MIDI passes through to your synth automatically

### Logic Pro

1. On your instrument track, click the **MIDI FX** slot (above the Instrument slot)
2. Choose **Chord Analyzer MIDI** under Dusk Audio
3. The plugin receives MIDI from the track and passes it through to your instrument

### Cubase / Nuendo

1. On your instrument track, add **"Chord Analyzer MIDI"** as a MIDI insert
2. The plugin receives MIDI from the track automatically
3. Your instrument remains unchanged

### Ableton Live

Ableton doesn't list MIDI-only plugins in MIDI tracks the same way other DAWs do, so use the **instrument version** with an Instrument Rack:

1. Load your synth on a MIDI track as normal
2. Select your synth and press **Cmd+G** (Mac) or **Ctrl+G** (Windows) to group it into an **Instrument Rack**
3. Click the **Show Chain List** button (three horizontal lines on the left side of the rack)
4. Right-click in the empty space below your synth's chain and choose **Create Chain**
5. Drag **"Chord Analyzer"** (the instrument version, not MIDI) from the browser into the new empty chain
6. Both chains receive the same MIDI, so your synth produces sound and the Chord Analyzer shows chords

### FL Studio

Use the **instrument version** with Patcher:

1. Add a **Patcher** instance to your channel rack
2. Inside Patcher, add both **"Chord Analyzer"** and your synth as nodes
3. Route the MIDI input to both plugins in parallel
4. Route only your synth's audio output to the Patcher output
5. Both plugins receive MIDI, so your synth produces sound and the Chord Analyzer shows chords

### Desktop LV2 Hosts (Ardour, Carla)

Use **Chord Analyzer MIDI**: it declares no audio ports and provides a full custom visualizer in the host plugin window.

1. Add **"Chord Analyzer MIDI"** to the MIDI chain before your synth
2. MIDI passes through to the next plugin in the chain
3. Open the plugin to see the full chord display

### Headless LV2 Hosts (Zynthian)

Use **Chord Analyzer Headless**: it exposes the detected chord through native LV2 output control ports so the host can render it in its own UI.

1. Install the bundle from the `chord-analyzer-headless-*.zip` (separate download)
2. Add **"Chord Analyzer Headless"** to your MIDI chain before your synth
3. The detected root, quality, bass and inversion appear as live values in your host's plugin parameter view

## Installation

| Platform | Format | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Linux | VST3 | `~/.vst3/` |
| Linux | LV2 | `~/.lv2/` |
| macOS | AU | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/` |
| macOS | VST3 | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/` |
| Windows | VST3 | `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\` |

The main download includes "Chord Analyzer" and "Chord Analyzer MIDI"; install whichever your DAW uses. The "Chord Analyzer Headless" variant ships in a separate `-headless-` zip aimed at Zynthian and other headless LV2 hosts; download it only if you need it.

## Open Source

Chord Analyzer is free and open source. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dusk-audio/dusk-audio-plugins).
