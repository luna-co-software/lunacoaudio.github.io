    date: "2026-09-06"
    changes:
      - "Calibration control on the faceplate (#144)"
      - "VU meter drawn with the shared needle meter"
      - "Framework update (DAF 22b82824, pugl d46e7871): the first click on an unfocused editor registers on macOS, macOS resize sizing fix, drawing state set up on the expose path, AU buffer handling fix, Wayland backend updated"
  - version: "1.0.10"
    date: "2026-08-29"
    changes:
      - "Fixed the window aspect the plugin reports to the host: it advertised 400x260 against an 800x470 design, so hosts that keep a plugin window on a fixed aspect sized the editor off its design"
      - "Fixed knob dragging stopping when the plugin window loses keyboard focus mid-drag"
  - version: "1.0.9"
    date: "2026-08-28"
    changes:
      - "Fixed VST3 meter output parameters being reported to the host as parameter edits, which churned the undo history in hosts such as Bitwig until Undo and Redo were no longer offered, and marked the project modified on every save (#233)"
      - "Added VST3 and CLAP regression harnesses, plus an editor drag test, that fail the build if output parameters reach the host or if a knob stops responding to the mouse"
  - version: "1.0.7"
    date: "2026-08-26"
    changes:
      - "Fixed CLAP VU meter output parameters being reported to the host as parameter changes, which made hosts such as Bitwig mark the project modified and constantly override the last-touched parameter (#231)"

      - Fixed the tape speed dropdown showing a question mark instead of the inch mark
      - Gain Link holds levels more consistently across bypass, preset and processing changes

  - version: "1.0.4"
    date: "2026-07-24"
    changes:
      - "Fixed the LV2 version failing to load in strict hosts (Ardour reported no ports; Reaper reported a TTL parse error). The Head Width labels now use a proper inch mark that keeps the plugin metadata valid."

    date: "2026-07-19"
    changes:
      - Program-band tone matching: new correction bands keyed to a 500 Hz program envelope, neutral at the calibration anchor
      - Deep-sub program bloom restores the reference decks' low-end thickening on hot material
      - Per-preset repro sub-bell and lowpass resonance for closer factory-preset matching
      - Crosstalk retuned to the reference; presets now honor their own Crosstalk switch
      - Preset "Massive Bass" renamed "Bass Bump"
      - Click the title nameplate to view Patreon supporters
      - Fixed presets resetting when closing the DAW, and a gain-linking issue
  - version: "1.0.0"
    date: "2026-07-15"
    changes:
      - Ground-up rebuild of TapeMachine on DAF (Dusk Audio Framework), our own framework derived from DPF, with AU, VST3, CLAP, and LV2 support
      - Swiss (A800-style) and American (ATR-102-style) machines
      - Anti-aliased waveshaping saturation with per-speed head bump and HF response

TapeMachine 2 is the next-generation Dusk Audio tape engine with two faithfully modeled reel-to-reel machines, each bringing authentic saturation, head response, and machine character. Completely free.

## Overview

Analog tape has shaped the sound of recorded music for decades. TapeMachine 2 captures the magic of two legendary studio machines with anti-aliased waveshaping saturation and per-speed head-response modeling, tuned against reference hardware behavior.

Whether you want subtle glue on your mix bus, punchy tracking color, or heavy lo-fi character, TapeMachine 2 delivers authentic tape sound across two distinct machines.

## Tape Machine Models

TapeMachine 2 recreates two iconic decks, each with its own saturation character and head response:

**Swiss** (A800-style)
- Clean, punchy, and precise
- Transformerless signal path
- Tight low end with extended highs
- The modern studio workhorse

**American** (ATR-102-style)
- Warm, rich, and musical
- Transformer coloration with adjustable head width
- Pronounced head bump and smooth top end
- ATR-style front-panel toggles: Crosstalk, Wow & Flutter, and Transformer
- The mastering room classic

## Tape Formulations

Choose from four tape types, each with distinct sonic characteristics:

| Type | Character | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **456** | Warm, punchy saturation | Rock, pop, mix bus |
| **GP9** | Clean, extended headroom | Mastering, classical |
| **900** | European precision | Warmth, character |
| **250** | Vintage, early saturation | Lo-fi, creative effects |

## Tape Speeds

Four selectable speeds, each with its own head bump and high-frequency response:

| Speed | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| **30 IPS** | Tightest low end, most extended highs |
| **15 IPS** | The studio standard, balanced head bump |
| **7.5 IPS** | Warmer, more pronounced low-frequency bump |
| **3.75 IPS** | Lo-fi character (American) |

## Signal Path Modes

Like a real tape machine, TapeMachine 2 offers multiple signal paths:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Repro** | Full tape processing, the classic sound |
| **Sync** | Record-head playback with extra HF rolloff (for overdub workflows) |
| **Input** | Electronics only, hear just transformers and EQ coloration |
| **Thru** | Clean bypass for A/B comparison |

## EQ Standards

Two professional equalization standards on both machines:

| Standard | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **NAB** | American: more HF pre-emphasis, warmer saturation |
| **CCIR** | European: balanced, precise response |

## Head Width & Bias

- **Head width** (American machine only): 1/4", 1/2", or 1" head stack for different weight and low-end behavior.
- **Bias & Auto Bias:** dial in bias manually, or let Auto Bias find the optimal operating point.
- **Auto Compensation:** holds unity output while driving the tape for color, so louder saturation never means a louder mix.

## Repro EQ

A four-band advanced Repro EQ models the hardware repro-head path:

- **LF shelf:** low-frequency weight and body
- **LMF peak:** low-mid warmth and fullness
- **HMF peak:** presence and high-mid detail
- **HF shelf:** air and top-end sheen

## Wow & Flutter

TapeMachine 2 features separate controls for wow and flutter:

**Wow:** slow pitch drift
- Creates subtle vinyl-like wobble
- Adds organic movement to sustained notes
- Perfect for lo-fi and vintage vibes

**Flutter:** faster modulation
- Adds tape machine character
- Creates subtle chorus-like effects

Both effects share coherent stereo processing for a natural, phase-aligned sound, and can be disabled together from the American front panel.

## Factory Presets

TapeMachine 2 ships with 20 factory presets, each modeled on the hardware units' classic settings, across five categories:

**American: Master**
- Big 456 Master, Nice 456 Master, Jazz Vision Master, Clean 900 Master

**American: Color**
- Fat 456 Master, GP9 Drum Bus, Bass Bump, Bright & Sizzly

**Swiss: Mix**
- Classic Rock Crisp, Modern Rock, Drum Bus, Hi-Fi Shine, Lush Film, Jazz Warmth

**Swiss: Color**
- Thick Saturation, Hip-Hop Punch, Vocal Presence

**Lo-Fi**
- Sunbaked Cassette, Analog Warmth, Old Tape

## Technical Specifications

### DSP Details
- **Saturation:** anti-aliased waveshaping with per-speed head-bump and HF response modeling

- **Repro path:** four-band advanced Repro EQ modeled on the hardware repro head
- **Metering:** dual stereo VU meters with vintage analog ballistics

### Parameter Ranges
- **Input Gain (drive):** ±12dB
- **Output Gain:** ±12dB
- **Bias:** 0 to 100%
- **Wow:** 0 to 100%
- **Flutter:** 0 to 100%
